**New Safety Rules Implemented:**

```

### 4. Cross-Domain Integration

**RAG Behavior:**
```python
retrieve_context(query, k=3)
# Intelligently searches across all 27 chunks
# Returns most relevant content regardless of domain
# Automatic safety scaling based on content type
```

## Safety Implementation

### Rule Enforcement

**Layer 1: Knowledge Base Design**
- Only educational content included
- Each section has safety disclaimer
- No risky investment promotion
- Government schemes as informational only

**Layer 2: System Prompt**
- Explicit prohibition of advice
- Mandatory disclaimer language
- Domain-specific behavior rules
- Fallback mechanisms for unsafe queries

**Layer 3: Response Post-Processing**
- Automatic disclaimer injection
- Risky keyword detection
- Context-aware safety scaling

### What Triggers Auto Disclaimer

✅ Financial questions → Auto-include disclaimer  
✅ Investment concepts → Auto-include disclaimer  
✅ Scheme explanations → Auto-include disclaimer  
✅ Cross-domain responses → Auto-include multiple disclaimers

## Usage Examples

### For End Users

```python
from llm.integration_example import answer_query

# Finance literacy question
answer = answer_query("How do I save 10000 per month effectively?")
print(answer)
# Output: Educational steps + safety disclaimer
```

### For Integration

```python
from rag.retriever import retrieve_context
from llm.gemini_client import generate_response

# Retrieve from all 27 chunks
context = retrieve_context("What is PPF?", k=3)

# Generate with safety
response = generate_response(
    query="What is PPF?",
    context=context,
    temperature=0.4,
    max_tokens=600
)
