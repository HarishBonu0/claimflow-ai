## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Voice Processing Flow
```python
def process_voice_input(audio_file, language_code):
    # 1. Speech to Text (Whisper)
    user_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
    
    # 2. Generate Response (with safety checks)
    response_text = generate_response(user_text)
    
    # 3. Text to Speech (gTTS)
    audio_path = text_to_speech(response_text, language=language_code)
    
    return {user_text, response_text, audio_path}
```

### Session State Management
```python
st.session_state.voice_enabled = True
st.session_state.selected_language = 'English'
st.session_state.last_voice_response_audio = filepath
```

### Language Mapping
```python
LANGUAGE_CODES = {
    'English': 'en',
    'Hindi': 'hi',
    'Telugu': 'te',
    'Tamil': 'ta',
    'Kannada': 'kn',
    'Spanish': 'es',
    'French': 'fr',
    'German': 'de',
    'Portuguese': 'pt',
    'Japanese': 'ja',
    'Chinese (Simplified)': 'zh-cn',
    'Chinese (Traditional)': 'zh-tw',
}
```
