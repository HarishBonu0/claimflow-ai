5-YEAR ASSET BUILDING PLAN

STEP 1: Build Emergency Fund
First, save money for emergencies.
Emergency = Unexpected costs (medical, job loss).
Save money in a bank account you can access quickly.
Goal: 3-6 months of living expenses.
Timeline: 1 year.

STEP 2: Save Money Every Month
Decide how much to save each month.
Save the same amount every month.
This builds discipline.
Example: Save 10000 rupees every month.
Timeline: Years 1-5 (continuous).

STEP 3: Learn and Grow Skills
Invest in yourself with education.
Take courses to improve skills.
Better skills = Better job = Higher income.
Timeline: Throughout 5 years.

STEP 4: Divide Your Savings (Multiple Options)
After emergency fund, spread money across safe options:
- Some in savings account (liquid = easy to access)
- Some in fixed deposits (locked, but safe returns)
- Some in government schemes (very safe)
- Some in mutual funds (long-term growth)

This is called "diversification" (not putting all eggs in one basket).

STEP 5: Monitor and Grow
Check your savings quarterly.
Celebrate progress.
Keep increasing income through skills.
Let your money grow slowly.
