Initial Review

When you file a claim, company first checks:

1. Is policy active? (Are you paying the fee?)

4. Is claim valid? (Did it really happen?)

This takes 1-5 days.

If any answer is NO, claim may be rejected.

कंपनी पहले यह जांच करती है कि क्या पॉलिसी सक्रिय है।

కంపెనీ మొదట పాలసీ సక్రియంగా ఉందో లేదో తనిఖీ చేస్తుంది.
